# Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa

Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004).
Jones et al (1998) made several studies but continental-scale no measurements have not previously been made.

A large uncertainty in modelling BBOA is extent to which measurements in the literature can be applied at regional scale.

#Simulation section
We simulate the evolution of particle sizes as they are transported away from the production region.

We compared our measurements of particle ageing with a model simulation.
The model is detailed in Smith et al 2002.

The particle was very small.
